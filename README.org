- [[file:timeline.py][timeline.py]] :: Visualize albums as timeline.

  Requirements:
  - Python: ~pip install pandas pillow dash mutagen~
  - Proper id3 metadata, specifically, publication years, for each file.
  - A cover image (e.g., "cover.jpg") in each album directory
    ([[https://pypi.org/project/get-cover-art/][get-cover-art]] can do that with the options ~--art-dest-inline~
    and ~--no-embed~).
